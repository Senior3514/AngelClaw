# Agentless – Cloud Connectors & Legacy Scanners

This module provides agentless integration with cloud environments and legacy systems
where installing a full ANGELNODE is not feasible.

## Structure

- `connectors/` – API-based connectors for AWS, Azure, GCP that pull configuration and audit logs.
- `scanners/` – Lightweight scanners for misconfiguration detection without a resident agent.

## Status

Placeholder — implementation planned for a future milestone.
